Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
---------------------------------------
It is a structured process used by software development teams to plan, design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software products. , defining, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

The purpose of SDLC is to ensure that the software product meets the customer's requirements, is delivered on time and within budget, and is of high quality and maintainable over its lifetime.


Phases:
1. Requirements Gathering:

Gather all the data like what the customer wants to build, who will be the end user, what is the objective of the product. SRS (Software Requirement Specification)


2. Defining:

Gathering the high-level requirements and refining them according to project goals

Functional vs Non Functional requrirement: Functional requirements describe what a software system should do, while non-functional requirements describe how a software system should perform. Non Functional: 
Portability,
Security,
Maintainability,
Reliability,
Scalability,
Performance,
Reusability,
Flexibility

3. Designing:

It is a mechanism to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation.

Internal design, also known as low-level design, is the process of creating detailed designs for individual software components or modules. It involves creating algorithms, data structures, and other technical details needed to implement the functionality specified in the requirements document.

External design, also known as high-level design, is the process of defining the overall architecture of the software system. It involves identifying the major components of the system, their relationships, and the interfaces between them. External design also includes defining the user interface and specifying the functionality that the system will provide.

The internal design stage comes after the external design stage. Once the external design is completed, the internal design can begin.

4. Coding:

The actual development starts and the product is built. Programming tools are used. Different high level programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal, Java and PHP are used for coding. 

5. Testing:

Code is tested against the requirements to make sure that the products are solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements stage.

6. Deployment:

Once the software is certified, and no bugs or errors are stated, then it is deployed. make a software system available for use. 

7. Maintainance:

Once when the client starts using the developed systems, then the real issues come up and requirements to be solved from time to time.

SDLC Models

1. Waterfall

Seen Steady Downward Flow, One phase act as a input to other phase. 

When to use: Requrirement are clearly defined, No need to change in requrirement in future, Project is Short, .

Not to use: Not good for Longterm/ Complex projects, Where requirement are not cleared, One way (We can't move to back stage after one stage is completed).

Note: No customer Interaction until project is completed, Required gathering one time.

Incremental Model:

When to use: Requrirement are clearly defined.

When not to use: More resources are required, Not suitable for changing requrirement, Not good for smalled projects

Note: Required gathering one time, Major Functionality Defined only minor changes allowded, New Technology is used, Customer attention is required.
